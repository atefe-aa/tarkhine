Introduction:

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my  Chain Restaurant Tarkhine project. I'm a junior web developer, and this project represents my journey in learning and implementing backend development using the Laravel framework.

Project Overview:

This project aims to provide a foundation for creating powerful web applications with a focus on the backend logic. Here's what you can expect:

Laravel Framework: I've built this API using the Laravel framework, a robust and developer-friendly PHP framework that ensures security, scalability, and maintainability.

RESTful API: The project follows RESTful API principles, making it easy to interact with from the front-end applications, including those built with React.js.

Ongoing Learning: This is a project in progress. I'm continuously learning and improving the codebase. Feel free to provide feedback, suggestions, or contribute to its development.

Getting Started:

To get started with the project, you can follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using composer install.
Configure your environment variables in the .env file.
Run migrations and seed the database with sample data.
Start the development server using php artisan serve.
Contributions and Feedback:

I'm open to collaboration and would appreciate your input. If you have ideas for improvements, spot any issues, or want to contribute, please feel free to create issues, pull requests, or reach out to me directly. Let's learn and grow together!
